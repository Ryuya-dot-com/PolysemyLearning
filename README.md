# L2 Vocabulary Learning System - Replication of Polysemy and Homonymy Acquisition Research

## üìã Overview

This system is a web-based research application designed to measure vocabulary acquisition effects in second language (L2) learning, based on the study by Gonz√°lez-Fern√°ndez & Webb (2024): "How well are primary and secondary meanings of L2 words acquired?"

**Original Paper**: Gonz√°lez-Fern√°ndez, B., & Webb, S. (2024). How well are primary and secondary meanings of L2 words acquired? *Studies in Second Language Acquisition*, 1-23.

## üéØ Research Objectives

This system is designed to investigate the following research questions:

1. **RQ1**: To what extent can new polysemous and homonymous meanings of familiar L2 words be learned deliberately and does prior L2 vocabulary knowledge affect this learning?

2. **RQ2**: Are there any differences between the deliberate acquisition of polysemous and homonymous meanings of familiar words, and the primary meaning of unknown words?

## üî¨ Experimental Design

### Participant Groups
- **Treatment Group**: 36 participants (flashcard learning + tests)
- **Control Group**: 30 participants (tests only)
- **Target Population**: Low-to-intermediate level EFL learners

### Target Vocabulary (30 words)
- **Secondary polysemous meanings**: 10 words (e.g., body "organization," chair "chairperson")
- **Secondary homonymous meanings**: 10 words (e.g., bank "embankment," pen "enclosure")  
- **Primary meanings of unknown words**: 10 words (e.g., flesh "meat," hutch "small shelter")

### Experimental Procedure
1. **Pretest** (1 week prior): Meaning recall + meaning recognition tests
2. **Learning Session** (15 minutes): Flashcard learning (10 min learning + 5 min retrieval)
3. **Immediate Posttest**: Tests immediately after treatment
4. **Delayed Posttest** (1 week later): Retention measurement

## üìä Key Findings from Original Paper

### üîç **Major Discoveries**
1. **Learning secondary meanings of familiar words is as difficult as learning primary meanings of unfamiliar words**
   - Meaning recognition: Secondary meanings 90.12% vs Primary meanings 86.8%
   - Meaning recall: Secondary meanings 71.8% vs Primary meanings 70.3%

2. **No significant difference between polysemy and homonymy acquisition**
   - Etymological relatedness does not affect learning outcomes
   - L2 learners cannot leverage etymological connections between meanings

3. **Positive effect of prior vocabulary knowledge**
   - Learners with greater vocabulary knowledge acquire new meanings more easily

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements

- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions recommended)
- **JavaScript**: Must be enabled
- **Screen Resolution**: 1024√ó768 or higher recommended

### 2. Experiment Implementation
1. Open `index.html` in web browser
2. Enter participant information (name, student ID)
3. Follow experimental protocol

### 3. Experimental Protocol (Following Original Paper)

#### **Session 1: Pretest (approx. 70 minutes)**
1. **Meaning Recall Test**: Describe meanings of 40 words in Japanese
2. **Vocabulary Levels Test**: Measure prior vocabulary knowledge
3. **Meaning Recognition Test**: Multiple choice questions for 40 words
4. **Language Background Questionnaire**

#### **Session 2: Learning + Immediate Test (approx. 60 minutes)**
1. **Flashcard Learning** (15 minutes)
   - 10 min: Free learning phase
   - 5 min: Retrieval practice phase
2. **Filler Task** (10 minutes): Questions about English learning experience
3. **Immediate Posttest**: Meaning recall + meaning recognition

#### **Session 3: Delayed Test (approx. 45 minutes)**
1. **One-week delayed posttest**: Retention effect measurement

## üìä Data Collection & Analysis

### Measurement Instruments
- **Meaning Recall Test**: L2‚ÜíL1 translation task
- **Meaning Recognition Test**: 5-option multiple choice (including "I don't know")
- **Learning Behavior Log**: Card flipping, shuffling, navigation records
- **Response Time**: Time taken for each question

### Statistical Analysis
- **Relative Gains Calculation**: `[(posttest score - pretest score) / (number of items - pretest score)] √ó 100`
- **Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models**: Analyze effects of vocabulary type, group, prior knowledge
- **Effect Sizes**: Cohen's d, eta squared

## üîß Experimental Conditions Setup

### Vocabulary Selection Criteria (Following Original Paper)
- **Word Length**: 3-5 letters
- **Part of Speech**: Nouns only
- **Frequency**: Known words within 2K, unknown words 3K-12K
- **Cognates**: Excluded cognates with participants' L1 (Japanese)
- **Etymological Classification**: Based on Oxford English Dictionary

### Definition of Polysemy and Homonymy
- **Polysemous**: Related meanings derived from the same origin
- **Homonymous**: Unrelated meanings from different origins
- **Peripheral Meanings**: Meanings listed third or later in dictionaries

## üìà Educational Implications

### Recommendations from Original Paper
1. **Effectiveness of Deliberate Instruction**: Explicit flashcard instruction is effective
2. **Equal Learning Difficulty**: Secondary meanings require as much instructional effort as primary meanings
3. **Non-importance of Etymological Distinction**: Polysemy vs. homonymy distinction doesn't affect low-proficiency learners

### Practical Applications
- Importance of teaching multiple meanings of high-frequency words
- Ensuring adequate learning time for each new meaning
- Prioritizing explicit meaning presentation over etymological explanations
